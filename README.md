A simple chat application created using socket.io and the express framework.

To see a working demo:
http://simple-chat-application.herokuapp.com/

Nothing fancy, just the demo of the functionality.

To run this app locally, you would need:
nodeJS
express
socket.io

You can install all these dependencies simply by running
npm install
from the terminal.

Alternatively you can get them individually.
You can get nodeJS here:
http://nodejs.org/

To install express run:
npm install express

To install socket.io run:
npm install socket.io

Once all dependencies have been installed, move to the folder containing the application's files in the terminal and type:
node app.js

To see the app, open your browser and type:
localhost:8080

I have just begun making web apps, so I would appreciate any feedback.I'm sure I must have used a ton of bad practises.Maybe there is a better way or there is a security issue.In any case, please let me know.
